1. Create a regular expression pattern for a phone number and test it with a variety of numbers, good and bad.

$phone = "^\d{3}-\d{4}$"

"555-1234","5-1234","555-2222","123-45667","444-4455" | where {$_ -match $phone}

2. Create a text file of phone numbers and use Select-String to find all numbers that match.

get-content phonenumbers.txt | select-string $phone -Allmatch

3. Repeat #2 but find all numbers that do not match.

Did you read the help for Select-String?

get-content phonenumbers.txt | select-string $phone -Allmatch -NotMatch
