1. Create a local background job to find the latest 100 errors in the system event log. 
Then retrieve the results.

start-job {get-eventlog system -newest 100 -EntryType Error} -Name SystemErrors
receive-job SystemErrors -keep

Or receive job by its ID

2. Run a remote command to get the size of the $env:temp folder on one or more 
remote computers, or specify your computer name and localhost. But do this as a 
local background job. Retrieve the results.

receive-job $j -keep
