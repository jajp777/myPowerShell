1. Run update help for your computer

Update-Help

2. From your computer save help to a shared folder.

Save-Help -destination \\mycomputer\pshelp
or just use a local folder that you have created
Save-Help -destination c:\pshelp

3. Update help again from the shared folder for your computer or another computer.

Update-Help -source \\mycomputer\pshelp -force

You might need to force the update if you run these commands all on the same day.
