1. Get all running processes and save them to a variable called processes.

PS C:\> $processes = Get-Process

2. Write the contents of the processes variable to the pipeline

any of these will work
PS C:\> $processes
PS C:\> Write-Output $processes
PS C:\> write $processes
PS C:\> $processes | write-output

3. Pipe the processes variable to a text file

this is preferred
PS C:\> $processes | out-file myprocesses.txt

although this will work as well.
PS C:\> $processes > myprocesses.txt

4. For each process in your variable, take the workingset property and divide it by 1MB, displaying the result.

You could do it this way using ForEach-Object
PS C:\> $processes | ForEach {$_.workingset/1MB}

or you could use the ForEach enumerator

PS C:\> foreach ($item in $processes) {$item.workingset/1mb}

5. Where do you think you could learn more about pipelines?

PS C:\> help pipeline

I didn't demonstrate this because you should be using the help system to discover things on your own.
