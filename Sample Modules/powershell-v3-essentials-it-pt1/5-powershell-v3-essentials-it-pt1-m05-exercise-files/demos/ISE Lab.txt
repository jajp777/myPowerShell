1. Configure the ISE to save the last 7 opened files

Open the ISE from the prompt or shortcut
go to: Tool - Options - General Settings
At the bottom under Other Settings change "Number of recent files to show" to 7.
Click OK

2. Set the Intellisense timeout to 5 seconds

In the same tab under Intellisense, set the value to 5.
Click OK


3. Configure the console pane to have a black background. 

go to: Tool - Options - Colors and Fonts
Under Console Pane select Background
Click on the black square
Click OK

4. Restart the ISE. Is it still black? What about the other settings?

Some settings are persistent, like the number of recent files and Intellisense timeout. 
Others only last for as long as the ISE is running. To make the changes more permanent
you would need to use the ISE profile script and use the PSISE Object model to configure
the ISE everytime you started it.
